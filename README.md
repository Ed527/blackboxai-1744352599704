## Project Overview
The NSMQ App is an online platform designed for students preparing for the National Science and Maths Quiz (NSMQ). The app offers features such as quizzes, AI assistance for questions, user authentication, and a premium subscription plan for enhanced learning experiences. The user-friendly interface is built using Tailwind CSS, providing a responsive and visually appealing design.

   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd nsmq-app
   ```

2. Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser.

3. No additional software installations are necessary as the app is primarily HTML, CSS, and plain JavaScript.

## Dependencies
The project includes the following CDN dependencies directly referenced in the HTML files:
